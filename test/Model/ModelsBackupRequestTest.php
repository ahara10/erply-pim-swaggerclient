/**
 * PIM API
 *
 * Product information management API -------  <details><summary>Summary</summary>  It is built top of Erply's current product database.  Its goal is to allow user to:  * Extend the dataset (ie., users can decide what fields a product can have, and can themselves define an arbitrary number of categorizations); * Get data in and out of the system easily (ie. an API must support imports and integrations); * Easily make large-scale updates (ie., recategorize items in bulk, make whole catalogs or groups active or inactive) * Support omni-channel organization (allow specifying which products should be available in which sales channels) * Enrich data (see which items have a certain property missing, fill missing fields)  Product information management API is compatible with Erply's current data model, and the existing API calls </details>  <details><summary>Auth with Cookies</summary>  Add `apisession_<yourClientCode>` cookie with your session key + `clientCode` HTTP header </details>  <details><summary>Bulk operations</summary>  The bulk operations are processed concurrently, therefore the response items order is not the same as the request items one.   Each bulk response item has its own identifier:  **resultID**.  The **resourceID** field refer to the REST resource being worker with. </details>  <details><summary>Response headers on every endpoint</summary>  * **Request-Time-Unix** header contains server time in a format of unix timestamp. </details>  <details><summary>Filtering & Sorting</summary> The filtering and sorting parameters provide flexibility to the user to accelerate user's performance and increase efficiency.  ### Filtering:  The 'filter' query parameter represents a JSON array of arrays of length 3 and a string. Each array represents a filter and the string - operand: **and**, **or**. For the array, 1st string is the field name, 2nd string is the operands, and the 3rd object is the value (can be any type). Supported operands: **=**, **!=**, **>=**, **<=**, **in**, **contains** and **startswith**.  <details><summary>general filtering JSON example</summary> a filter to fetch actively sold burgers with groupID more than 2. > <blockquote> > <pre><code> > [ >    [ >        &quot;id&quot;, >        &quot;in&quot;, >        [1, 2, 3] >    ], >    [ >        &quot;group_id&quot;, >        &quot;>=&quot;, >        &quot;2&quot; >    ], >    &quot;and&quot;, >    [ >        &quot;status&quot;, >        &quot;!=&quot;, >        &quot;ACTIVE&quot; >    ], >    &quot;and&quot;, >    [ >        &quot;name.en&quot;, >        &quot;contains&quot;, >        &quot;burger&quot; >    ] > ] > </code></pre> > </blockquote> </details>  <details><summary>single filter JSON example</summary> The single filter must be still an array of arrays. For example a filter to fetch active records. > <blockquote> > <pre><code> > [ >    [ >        &quot;status&quot;, >        &quot;=&quot;, >        &quot;ACTIVE&quot; >    ] > ] > </code></pre> > </blockquote> </details>  #### 'or' operand <details><summary>filtering 'or' operand JSON example</summary> for example a filter to fetch matrix or bundle products:  > <blockquote> > <pre><code> > [ >   [ >       &quot;type&quot;, >       &quot;=&quot;, >       &quot;MATRIX&quot; >   ] >   &quot;or&quot;, >   [ >       &quot;type&quot;, >       &quot;=&quot;, >       &quot;BUNDLE&quot; >   ] > ] > </code></pre> > </blockquote> </details>   In the previous example we have used the same classifier 'type' multiple times - in two filters.   **NB!** Translatable classifiers such as name and description, etc **cannot be used** multiple times,  For example you cannot lookup products that have english name 'apple' and/or greek name 'μήλο'.  ### Sorting  The sorting parameter is the 'sort' query parameter. It's a JSON object with 3 fields: 1. selector - field name, example value:added, 2. desc - short for descending, value: true or false, 3. language: example value: gr, is used to sort by translatable fields such as name.  <details><summary>sorting JSON example</summary>  > <blockquote> > <pre><code> > { >    &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;added&quot;, >    &quot;desc&quot;: true, >    &quot;language&quot;: &quot;gr&quot; > } > </code></pre> > </blockquote> </details>  </details>  <details><summary>Backup & Restore</summary>  With PIM API you can create a backup of the product catalogue  and then restore it when needed. ### Creating a backup To **create a backup** you need to specify the **backup_id** field on the product when creating or updating it one by one or in bulk.   It is allowed to have only one backup at a time. All new backups will override the previous ones. For example, if you created and updated some products specifying with backup_id equals 3, then the  first **create or update** operation with the backup_id equals 7 will delete all the backups associated with the backup_id equals 3.  ### Restoring To **restore** you should request the ```/product/restore``` endpoint with the **backup_id**.  </details>  ------- **[Go SDK](https://github.com/erply/pim-go-wrapper)** - make the API requests from your Go service with comfort.   -------
